Project Description:
This project is a Java program that reads in a text file containing information about intersections and roads in a city, constructs a graph representing the city, and allows the user to find the shortest path between two intersections. The program also displays the city map in a window using the Java Swing library. The map shows the roads connecting the intersections as lines, with thicker blue lines indicating the shortest path between two highlighted intersections. The program takes command-line arguments to specify whether to show the map or output directions between two intersections. The program has a "proj3" main method and utilizes the Node, Graph, and Edge classes in order to display Dijkstra's algorithm through the means of road mapping. In this project, Alex was responsible for creating the Graph, Node, and Edge classes while Jackson brought it all together using the created methods and displaying them using java graphics. The most difficult part of the lab was definitely implementing principles from Dijkstra's algorithm into our lab, as well as using java graphics to display said functions. As for the runtime of the project, best case scenario is typically O(mn), where m is number of input terms and n is number of nodes. With each of the maps we ran (ur, monroe, ny), the runtime increased, as number of nodes would greatly increase with the mapped points.
